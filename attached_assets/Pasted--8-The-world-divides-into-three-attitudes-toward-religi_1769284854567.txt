• 8. The world divides into three attitudes toward religion: uncritical acceptance, rejection, and critical acceptance.
• 8.1 Uncritical acceptance is the state of not knowing the possibility of non-acceptance.
• 8.11 This state is not possible for a member of contemporary society.
• 8.12 The so-called fundamentalist chooses his position; it is a reaction, not a natural state.
• 8.13 The tribesman’s belief is not a reaction; it is how he naturally sees the world.
• 8.2 Rejection has two forms: authentic and inauthentic.
• 8.21 Authentic rejection is based on a rationalistic worldview, as in Freud.
• 8.22 Inauthentic rejection is a way of fitting in or gaining prestige.
• 8.221 The mentality of inauthentic rejection is closer to religious fundamentalism than to authentic rationalism.
• 8.222 The contemporary atheist often follows the herd; his reasons may be as emotional and dogmatic as those of the medieval believer.
• 8.23 The brain-centers mediating militant atheism are identical to those mediating religious fundamentalism.
• 8.3 Critical acceptance is reflective acceptance.
• 8.31 There are two ways to be reflective: reductively and non-reductively.
• 8.311 Freud was reductively reflective about religion.
• 8.312 In his view, God represents a projection.
• 9. The subjective, emotional side of religion is the object of examination, not its objective, institutional side.
• 9.1 What James, Otto, and Eliade examine is not equivalent to 21st-century ‘spiritualism’.
• 9.11 21st-century spiritualism is a manifestation of contemporary nihilism.
• 9.12 It is therefore an expression of the absence of genuine spiritualism.

• 10. To examine religion is to distinguish between its reductive and non-reductive truths.
• 10.1 A reductive truth about religion explains its origin in psychological or social functions.
• 10.11 Freud provides such truths: God as the father, religion as mediator of biological and social functions.
• 10.12 These truths are not false, but incomplete.
• 10.2 A non-reductive truth about religion concerns its essence as lived experience.
• 10.21 William James grants reductive truths but seeks the non-reductive.
• 10.22 For James, the essence of religion lies in truths of the non-reductive kind.
• 10.3 The psychological genesis of a belief is not identical to its content or value.
• 10.31 That Newton’s science or Luther’s faith had psychological origins does not make them nothing but those origins.
• 10.32 To confuse the cause of a belief with its truth is a logical error.
• 10.4 Even if all Freudian reductions are correct, it does not follow that religion is nothing but a neurosis.
• 10.41 An activity motivated by distress is not thereby defined as that distress.
• 10.5 The objection that religion is pure subjectivity, with no corresponding reality, is a proposition, not a proof.
• 10.51 James, Otto, and Eliade question this proposition.
• 11. The perceptible world is the world known through sense and scientific inference from sense-data.
• 11.1 Religion asserts the perceptible world is not the whole world.
• 12. The essence of religion, according to James, is the belief in an unseen order.
• 12.1 Our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves to this order.
• 12.2 Against scientific rationalism: the world is not merely a machine of parts and mechanisms.
• 12.21 The unseen order suffuses the perceptible, giving it meaning and moral structure.
• 12.22 A life is meaningful to the extent it aligns with this order.
• 13. A value-judgment can be made about this religious conceit: it is psychologically necessary.
• 13.1 The judgment: even if false, we benefit from believing it true.
• 13.2 Belief in God can grant a measure of God-like strength.
• 13.21 To act ‘as if’ there were a God makes a genuine difference in moral life.
• 13.22 Faith proves a full equivalent in practical terms for a knowledge of the object.
• 13.3 Belief polarizes the whole life through the sentiment of reality attached to its object.

• 14. The strength of belief is not in its propositional content but in its magnetic orientation of the soul.
• 14.1 A belief may be intensely felt without being clearly represented.
• 14.11 This is like iron knowing magnets through its own polarization, not through description.
• 14.2 From this, an incoherence arises: one cannot derive strength from a belief one does not hold.
• 14.21 To manufacture belief for strength is to undermine the integrity of the belief-system.
• 14.22 This makes one weaker, not stronger.
• 14.3 The coherent point beneath the incoherence is that our motivational architecture is hewn to a presumption of a superintending moral order.
• 14.31 The conscious theories of the believer and the disbeliever differ.
• 14.32 Their subterranean emotional architectures do not.
• 14.4 Rationalism accounts only for the superficial part of mental life.
• 14.41 It has the prestige of loquacity and logic.
• 14.42 It fails to convince if opposed by dumb intuition.
• 14.5 Intuition and genius spring from a deeper level than rationalism inhabits.
• 14.51 The subconscious life prepares the premises; consciousness feels the weight of the result.
• 14.52 Something in one absolutely KNOWS this result is truer than any contradicting logic-chopping.
• 14.6 Mystical experience is to be understood in this context.
• 14.61 It is ineffable, transient, passive, and noetic.
• 14.62 It is the letting go, allowing real feelings to rise.
• 14.63 The fact that disinhibitory agents (nitrous oxide, LSD) induce such states confirms this.
• 14.64 The fact that inhibitory agents (antipsychotics) suppress them confirms this.
• 14.7 Therefore, it is not truly up to us whether to 'believe'.
• 14.71 Belief is etched into the structure of our psychological essence.
• 14.72 Our theories change; this unchanging essence is closer to the religious than the non-religious.
• 15. The essence of religious sentiment is the sense of the numinous.
• 15.1 The numinous is a presence suffusing the world, unknowable to reason or sense-perception.
• 15.2 To understand the numinous, one must first understand what it is not.
• 15.21 God conceived as a super-person is not the numinous.
• 15.211 An ogre on Olympus holds no mystery; it is the opposite of numinous.
• 15.22 God conceived as utterly rational, powerful, and just is also not the numinous.
• 15.221 Thus conceived, God is a person without limitation, but not mysterious.
• 15.3 Therefore, hyper-intelligence, hyper-justice, etc., are merely synthetical attributes.
• 15.31 It is not in virtue of these attributes that a being is God.
• 15.4 To be God is not to be a superman.

• 16. The numinous is not identical with the miraculous.
• 16.1 A miracle is a breach of natural law by a sapient being.
• 16.11 This breach is merely another hypothesis within a rationalist framework.
• 16.12 Its confirmation would modify, not reject, a rationalist world view.
• 16.2 Therefore, the miraculous is not the numinous, nor its necessary expression.
• 17. The numinous has attributes, but its essence resists definition.
• 17.1 It inspires awe or terror.
• 17.11 Awareness of it involves fascination and self-absorption.
• 17.12 It confers a sense of smallness within a larger cosmic order.
• 17.13 It is encountered in music, romantic attachment, and unjaded perception of nature.
• 17.14 It is holy, imposing moral obligation and purpose.
• 18. Awe and terror arise from the perception of the supernatural.
• 18.1 The terrifying is that which is dangerous and alien; the awe-inspiring is that which is excellent and alien.
• 18.11 Understanding diminishes terror and awe, transforming the supernatural into the natural.
• 18.12 Thus, sharks are terrifying only to those for whom they are, in effect, supernatural.
• 18.13 Great art is awe-inspiring only to those for whom its genesis is supernatural.
• 19. The numinous is a projection of psychological passivity.
• 19.1 The question ‘What is the numinous?’ is psychological, not metaphysical.
• 19.11 It is experienced when one’s guard is down: in openness, passive wonder, disinterested contemplation, or surrender.
• 19.12 The savage, the music listener, the lover—all are in a state of passivity.
• 19.2 This aligns with James: mystical and drug-induced states share this passivity, in contrast to activity.
• 19.21 The scientist and forester adopt an attitude of active deconstruction; they do not find the numinous.
• 20. For Eliade, the religious consciousness divides the world into the sacred and the profane.
• 20.1 The world is not seen as impersonal.
• 20.11 The more religious the person, the less the world is a mere machine.
• 20.12 Objects become manifestations of a higher presence: beneficent (sacred) or maleficent (profane).
• 20.2 Primitive man, the most religious, conceives of time as circular.

• 21. The conception of time is not singular.
• 21.1 A cyclical conception of time mirrors the seasons.
• 21.11 This conception is primordial and pre-civilizational.
• 21.12 It is the conception native to spiritualism and myth.
• 21.2 A linear conception of time is a march away from singular events.
• 21.21 This conception is historical and civilizational.
• 21.22 It is the conception native to religion and law.
• 22. The shift from cyclical to linear time is not caused by Abrahamic religion.
• 22.1 The cause is the invention of writing.
• 22.11 Writing creates history by fixing events in an irreversible record.
• 22.12 Writing enables economies of scale and complex legal systems.
• 22.2 History, as a linear sequence, begins with the written record.
• 22.21 Prior to writing, life is functionally cyclical.
• 22.22 Prior to writing, there is no ‘year zero’—no fixed point from which time recedes.
• 23. Myth does not represent historical consciousness.
• 23.1 Myth occurs in a hypothetical time, not a historical sequence.
• 23.11 The events of one myth bear no temporal relation to the events of another.
• 23.12 Myth is an ahistorical vessel for lessons.
• 24. Religion is early-stage rationalism.
• 24.1 Civilization—with its economies and laws—cannot exist without rationalism.
• 24.11 Tribal organization depends on the absence of this rationalism.
• 24.2 The shift from pre-Abrahamic to Abrahamic tradition is not between religions.
• 24.21 It is the shift from spiritualism to the codification required by civilization.
• 24.22 A religion proper begins when norms are written and codified.
• 24.3 Unwritten understandings cannot govern a large, differentiated group.
• 24.31 Judaism, Christianity, and Islam become full religions through legalistic codification.
• 24.4 What is called ‘rationalism’ today is merely late-stage rationalism.
• 24.41 Early-stage rationalism is the rationalism of foundational legal and economic norms.
• 24.42 Late-stage rationalism is the extension of this rigor to investigations of nature.
• 25. Intelligence is judgment about the world.
• 25.1 Rationality is judgment about one’s intelligence.

• 26. The written word is a scaffold for rational thought, not its foundation.
• 26.1 Literacy amplifies rationality but does not constitute it.
• 26.11 An individual can be rational without literacy, as rationality concerns operations of thought.
• 26.12 A society can be rationally structured without literacy, but literacy expands the possible structures.
• 26.2 The linearization of time is not a unique product of Abrahamic faith.
• 26.21 Many pre-Abrahamic civilizations possessed linear conceptions of time.
• 26.22 To attribute linear time solely to Abrahamism is a false deduction.

• 27. What James, Otto, and Eliade examine under the name ‘religion’ is not religion but precivilizational spiritualism.
• 27.1 The religion of Abrahamic faiths is not the object of their study.
• 27.11 The worldview of a member of an Abrahamic faith is largely indistinguishable from that of an ardent rationalist.
• 27.12 Their ‘beliefs’ often function as posits to emblematize values, not as representations of historical fact.
• 27.2 The fundamentalist’s animism is confined, bounded, and rational in its application.
• 27.21 He does not see spirits in twigs and rocks; he sees twigs and rocks.
• 27.22 His exceptional ‘beliefs’ serve as the basis for stable, rational social arrangements.
• 27.3 Religious people, such as the Amish or Hasidim, do not typically have ‘numinous’ experiences of the world as alive.
• 27.31 Their former spiritualist beliefs have hardened into acceptances that anchor ethical and legal codes.
• 27.4 Christianity and Islam are complex, internally consistent behavioral codes, not lived spiritualist experiences.
• 27.41 They stabilize social relations; their mythic relics are controlled instruments.
• 27.5 The mentality described by James, Otto, and Eliade is animistic, not religious in the contemporary sense.
• 27.51 Their error is terminological, not necessarily substantive.

• 28. James, Otto, and Eliade on the limits of rationalism.
• 28.1 Rationalism begins where spiritualism ends.
• 28.11 For the rationalist, the world is composed of moving parts.
• 28.12 There is nothing magical or mysterious in it; only knowns and unknowns.
• 28.2 For the rationalist, the unknown is a gap in knowledge, not a mystery.
• 28.3 For the rationalist, things are useful, harmful, or neutral.
• 28.31 Nothing is sacred; nothing is profane.
• 28.4 For the rationalist, morality concerns utility.
• 28.41 Some legal codes work better than others; this is a matter of social engineering.
• 28.42 There is morality, but no higher morality.
• 28.5 For the rationalist, the world is impersonal.
• 28.51 It is not a living being.

• 29. The world of the rationalist is dead matter, with life as anomaly requiring explanation.
• 29.1 To explain life is to reconcile it with a dead universe.
• 29.2 For the rationalist, the world is an object that exists to be used.
• 29.21 The claim to understand the world is the claim to dissect it.
• 30. For the spiritualist, the world is a subject.
• 30.1 The world does not exist only to be used; it is a partner.
• 30.11 As partner, the world teems with life and gives meaning.
• 30.2 Spiritualist morality is emotional, based on empathic rapport with God and nature.
• 30.3 For the spiritualist, organisms are more basic than dead matter.
• 30.31 The concept of impersonal force is alien to spiritualism.
• 31. James, Otto, and Eliade reference the invigorating effects of spiritualism.
• 31.1 Excessive rationalism is morbid; some spiritualism is necessary for mental health.
• 31.2 They do not advocate a return to innocent savagery.
• 31.3 Their position: we are already spiritual, but fail to recognize it.
• 31.31 This is analogous to Freud on sexuality: we cannot become asexual.
• 31.32 We can only wrongly believe we are asexual and make decisions that thwart our nature.
• 31.4 We cannot become non-spiritual.
• 31.41 We can wrongly believe we are non-spiritual.
• 31.42 This error may stem from seeing rationalism as rejection rather than rarefied extension of spiritualism.
• 31.43 On this erroneous basis, we adopt lifestyles contravening our spiritual nature.
