Unknown | Those arguments are spurious, we will find, because they all rest on the erroneous assumption that all non-empirical truths are trivial. | Introduction
Unknown | I will now argue that this contention of Kant’s is false and that his argument for it is spurious. | Introduction
Unknown | First, I will argue that the premises of Kant’s argument turn out to entail the opposite of the thesis that there are synthetic a priori truths. | Introduction
Unknown | Kant’s astonishing claims about causality, personal identity, and rationality turn out to be correct and founded on cogent arguments. | Introduction
Unknown | Kant’s reasoning must be “de-psychologized”, i.e. his statements about psychology must be reinterpreted as statements about logic. | Introduction
Unknown | In the first, we discuss the cogency of Kant’s arguments concerning causation and induction. | Introduction
Unknown | each of those arguments corresponds to a cogent argument that does not involve that assumption. | Introduction
Unknown | In the second part, we discuss the viability of Hume’s analyses of causation and induction. | Introduction
Unknown | It is argued that those analyses are fallacious, and an attempt is made to identify the relevant fallacies. | Introduction
Unknown | Kant’s false contention can readily be turned into a correct one and that his spurious argument can readily be turned into a cogent one. | Introduction
Unknown | In the third part, we draw some of the epistemological consequences of our response to Hume. | Introduction
Unknown | Kant turns out to be even more of an opponent of a priori truth than John Stuart Mill. | Introduction
Unknown | Kant held that some propositions are both synthetic and also a posteriori. | Introduction
Unknown | Kant and Hume on Induction, Causation, and the Methodology of the Human Sciences This paper is divided into three parts. | Introduction
