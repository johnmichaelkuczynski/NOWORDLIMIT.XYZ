--- KEY QUOTATIONS ---
1. If, in order to account for something of which you have knowledge, you posit the existence of something of which you don’t have knowledge; you have made an inference to the best explanation.
2. All theories are cases of inference to the best explanation.
3. Inference to the best explanation is a very powerful form of inference.
4. Induction by enumeration isn’t nearly as powerful a form of inference as inference to the best explanation.
5. In general, induction by enumeration is parasitic on inference to the best explanation.
6. The right definition of “confirms” is as follows. P confirms Q iff Q is more likely to be true if P is true than it is if, other things being equal, P is false.
7. Thus, for (i*) x drives a Rolls Royce to confirm (ii*) x is wealthy is for (ii*) to be more likely to be correct if (i*) is correct than it is if, holding everything else constant, (i*) is false.
8. Statements of the form “if P, then Q” are known as “conditionals.”
9. “P→Q” means that P entails Q, i.e., that it is impossible for P to be true if Q is false.
10. Statements of the form “if P then Q, and if Q then P” are known as “biconditionals.”
11. Material implication isn’t a form of implication at all.
12. Possibility and necessity are properties of statements, not objects.
13. Causal necessity isn’t logical necessity, of course.
14. A necessary condition for identity is sameness of properties.
15. A sufficient condition for identity is sameness of properties.
16. in any sense of the expression “same form” that isn’t circularly constructed to validate preexisting theories, S5 and S6 have the same form.
17. formal truth is parasitic on informal truth, the reason being that instances of formal truths are instances of informal ones
18. entailment cannot ultimately, or even proximately, be understood in formal terms
19. entailment is a logical notion. Confirmation is an explanatory notion.
20. The concept of “formal” (or “mechanical”) thought is therefore an incoherent one.
