    "Given any two lengths, there are intermediate lengths.",
    "There are therefore no minimal units of length.",
    "The essence of measurement is comparison with respect to a standard.",
    "There is no way to determine an object’s length except in terms of the length of some other object.",
    "Length is a scalar quantity.",
    "Day-to-day experience gives us approximate metrical knowledge, on the basis of which we can identify correlations on the basis of which we can obtain hitherto unobtainable metrical data.",
    "If it is to be known how two such events compare in respect of duration, one must know of some periodic process (some event-sequence, each of whose members is of the same type as its successor: e.g. the round-trips made by a beam of light between two mirrors, rotations of the earth or of a cesium atom, somebody's heartbeat) that occurred during each event and, further, one must know how many installments of that processes occurred during each.",
    "Conventionalism is false.",
    "An extensive magnitude is one such that the degree to which a given object has that magnitude exceeds the degree to any given one of its parts has that magnitude.",
    "A consequence---actually, the very essence of Special Relativity---is that there is no optical test by means of which one determine whether or not one is moving."
