1.0 Philosophy is the analysis of the categories in terms of which we understand the world.
1.1 These categories—such as person, fact, cause, knowledge, language, and justice—structure all thought.
1.2 The function of philosophy is to delineate the structures of these categories.
1.3 Philosophy is therefore the analysis of the preconditions of all knowledge.
2.0 Philosophical knowledge is metaknowledge—knowledge about knowledge.
2.1 The philosopher is interested in the laws governing the laws, not in the specific facts those laws describe.
2.2 The relationship of philosophy to other disciplines is one of increasing abstraction.
3.0 Analytic philosophy is distinguished by its method, which originates with Frege.
3.1 Analytic philosophy is driven by the acceptance of a key insight: logical form is not grammatical form.
3.2 Frege demonstrated that philosophical puzzles are solved by analyzing meanings, not by positing new entities.
3.3 Analytic philosophy is thus philosophy that seeks clarity through the logical analysis of statements.
4.0 A fundamental error is to assume that grammatical similarity implies semantic or logical similarity.
4.1 The wrong way to react is to twist reality to fit grammatical assumptions.
4.2 The right way to react is to discern the logical form beneath the grammatical surface.
4.3 Philosophical explanation is achieved by clarifying statements, not by doing para-science.
5.0 Analytic philosophy is ontologically conservative compared to pre-analytic philosophy.
5.1 Analytic philosophers do not solve problems by "ontologizing"—positing new entities without necessity.
5.2 Non-analytic philosophers, like Brentano and Meinong, epitomized the ontologizing method.
6.0 Philosophical puzzles differ in kind from empirical puzzles.
6.1 Empirical puzzles result from a lack of factual data or from inadequate modeling of available data.
6.2 Philosophical puzzles are purely conceptual; they result from confusion, not ignorance.
7.0 Not all philosophical analysis is linguistic analysis.
7.1 Wittgenstein erroneously held that all philosophical problems arise from the misuse of language.
7.2 These positions are incoherent and self-refuting.
7.3 Many philosophical disputes (e.g., in epistemology or philosophy of law) concern the truth of propositions whose meaning is agreed upon.
8.0 One must distinguish between sentences and propositions.
8.1 Sentences are linguistic artifacts; propositions are their mind- and language-independent meanings.
8.2 Truth and falsity are primarily properties of propositions.
8.3 Philosophical analysis is ultimately the analysis of propositions, not sentences.
9.0 Logical Positivism, inspired by the *Tractatus*, is an untenable doctrine.
9.1 Its core thesis: a statement is meaningful iff it is either tautological or empirically verifiable/falsifiable.
9.2 This thesis is self-defeating, as it is itself neither a tautology nor an empirical statement.
9.3 Furthermore, there are clear counterexamples: meaningful non-tautological, non-empirical truths exist.
9.4 The verificationist and falsificationist criteria of meaning are demonstrably inadequate.
10.0 The picture theory of meaning is false.
10.1 Sentences are not pictures of the facts they describe.
10.2 The empiricist motivation for the picture theory fails.
11.0 Not all entailment is formal entailment.
11.1 A formal entailment holds when the conditional linking premise to conclusion is formally true.
11.2 Many analytic truths (e.g., "circles are two-dimensional") are not formally true.
11.3 Therefore, the *Tractatus* project of reducing all logical relations to formal relations is impossible.
12.0 The concept of a logically perfect language is incoherent.
12.1 In a logically perfect language, grammatical form would perfectly mirror logical form.
12.2 This is impossible because no finite grammar can reflect the infinite complexity of logical relations.
12.3 Natural languages, despite their imperfections, are expressively superior to any putative logically perfect language.
13.0 Strict empiricism is self-refuting.
13.1 Empiricism claims all knowledge is based on observation.
13.2 This claim itself cannot be known through observation.
13.3 Therefore, if empiricism is true, there can be no grounds for believing it true.
13.4 Furthermore, foundational parts of scientific knowledge (e.g., involving irrational numbers) cannot have a strictly observational basis.
14.0 The sub-disciplines of philosophy analyze different but interconnected categories.
14.1 Philosophy of Mind studies categories like thought, belief, perception, and consciousness.
14.2 Philosophy of Language studies meaning, reference, and the nature of linguistic representation.
14.3 Epistemology studies the nature, scope, and limits of knowledge.
14.4 Philosophical Logic studies entailment, validity, and the structure of propositions.
14.5 Metaphysics studies existence, possibility, necessity, identity, and causation.
14.6 Philosophy of Science studies explanation, theory, confirmation, and the structure of scientific inquiry.
14.7 Ethics studies the nature of good, bad, right, and wrong.
14.8 Political and Legal Philosophy study the nature of law, government, justice, and legitimacy.
14.9 Philosophy of Religion studies concepts of divinity, faith, and religious knowledge.
14.10 Formal Logic studies the systematic formalization of valid inference.


--- Level 3 (99 statements) ---

1.0 Philosophy is the analysis of the categories in terms of which we understand the world.
1.1 These categories—such as person, fact, cause, knowledge, language, and justice—structure all thought.
1.1.1 We are adept at using these categories but seldom make them objects of thought.
1.1.2 Consequently, we possess little explicit knowledge about the categories themselves.
1.2 The function of philosophy is to delineate the structures of these categories.
1.2.1 This delineation constitutes the sole legitimate task of philosophy.
1.3 Philosophy is therefore the analysis of the preconditions of all knowledge.
1.3.1 It is the analysis of analysis, the logic of logic, the science of science.
2.0 Philosophical knowledge is metaknowledge—knowledge about knowledge.
2.1 The philosopher is interested in the laws governing the laws, not in the specific facts those laws describe.
2.1.1 The philosopher seeks to know what it would make sense to claim, not merely what is the case.
2.2 The relationship of philosophy to other disciplines is one of increasing abstraction.
2.2.1 The stranded motorist wants his car to work.
2.2.2 Thus, the philosopher's interest in specifics is subordinate to an interest in the categories they instantiate.
3.0 Analytic philosophy is distinguished by its method, which originates with Frege.
3.1 Analytic philosophy is driven by the acceptance of a key insight: logical form is not grammatical form.
3.1.1 When a belief seems to have an absurd consequence, one must question whether the absurdity truly follows.
3.1.2 Pre-Fregean philosophy often posited bizarre entities to reconcile beliefs with their apparent grammatical consequences.
3.2 Frege demonstrated that philosophical puzzles are solved by analyzing meanings, not by positing new entities.
3.2.1 For example, "nothing is a square circle" does not refer to a non-entity.
3.3 Analytic philosophy is thus philosophy that seeks clarity through the logical analysis of statements.
4.0 A fundamental error is to assume that grammatical similarity implies semantic or logical similarity.
4.1 The wrong way to react is to twist reality to fit grammatical assumptions.
4.1.1 For example, assuming "someone" functions like "John" leads to positing ambiguous or non-specific persons.
4.1.2 This path results in absurd theses about non-existent entities.
4.2 The right way to react is to discern the logical form beneath the grammatical surface.
4.2.1 Frege showed that "someone smokes" asserts the property of being a smoker is instantiated.
4.2.2 Quantified statements like "nobody smokes" are about properties (being uninstantiated), not about strange individuals.
4.3 Philosophical explanation is achieved by clarifying statements, not by doing para-science.
5.0 Analytic philosophy is ontologically conservative compared to pre-analytic philosophy.
5.1 Analytic philosophers do not solve problems by "ontologizing"—positing new entities without necessity.
5.1.1 Ontologizing is appropriate only when required to validate indisputably correct forms of inference.
5.1.2 When necessary, the posited entities are always abstract, never spatiotemporal.
5.2 Non-analytic philosophers, like Brentano and Meinong, epitomized the ontologizing method.
5.2.1 To account for hallucinations, they posited non-existent objects as the targets of mental acts.
5.2.2 Proper analysis shows that hallucinations, like veridical perceptions, encode existence-claims.
6.0 Philosophical puzzles differ in kind from empirical puzzles.
6.1 Empirical puzzles result from a lack of factual data or from inadequate modeling of available data.
6.1.1 Their solution involves acquiring new data or constructing better models of old data.
6.2 Philosophical puzzles are purely conceptual; they result from confusion, not ignorance.
6.2.1 Their solution requires logical analysis, not new observations.
6.2.2 Frege's solutions involved no new empirical discoveries, only a clearer understanding of what was already meant.
7.0 Not all philosophical analysis is linguistic analysis.
7.1 Wittgenstein erroneously held that all philosophical problems arise from the misuse of language.
7.1.1 In the *Tractatus*, he claimed philosophical statements are syntactically ill-formed nonsense.
7.1.2 In the *Investigations*, he claimed meaning is use and puzzles dissolve by examining ordinary usage.
7.2 These positions are incoherent and self-refuting.
7.2.1 The claim that all philosophical statements are nonsense is itself a philosophical statement.
7.2.2 Meaning cannot be identical with use, for knowledge of meaning guides use.
7.3 Many philosophical disputes (e.g., in epistemology or philosophy of law) concern the truth of propositions whose meaning is agreed upon.
7.3.1 The dispute is not about language but about whether a given proposition correctly describes reality.
8.0 One must distinguish between sentences and propositions.
8.1 Sentences are linguistic artifacts; propositions are their mind- and language-independent meanings.
8.2 Truth and falsity are primarily properties of propositions.
8.2.1 A sentence is true if it encodes a true proposition.
8.3 Philosophical analysis is ultimately the analysis of propositions, not sentences.
8.3.1 Frege's analyses of sentences were a means to discover general logical principles governing propositions.
9.0 Logical Positivism, inspired by the *Tractatus*, is an untenable doctrine.
9.1 Its core thesis: a statement is meaningful iff it is either tautological or empirically verifiable/falsifiable.
9.2 This thesis is self-defeating, as it is itself neither a tautology nor an empirical statement.
9.3 Furthermore, there are clear counterexamples: meaningful non-tautological, non-empirical truths exist.
9.3.1 Mathematical truths (e.g., truths of arithmetic) are not tautologies in the stipulated sense.
9.3.2 Principles of logic itself are not empirically verifiable.
9.4 The verificationist and falsificationist criteria of meaning are demonstrably inadequate.
9.4.1 Universal generalizations cannot be conclusively verified.
9.4.2 Existential statements cannot be conclusively falsified.
10.0 The picture theory of meaning is false.
10.1 Sentences are not pictures of the facts they describe.
10.1.1 Sentential representation is heavily conventional; pictorial representation is not.
10.1.2 Sentences have digital, discrete structures; pictures have analog, continuous structures.
10.2 The empiricist motivation for the picture theory fails.
10.2.1 Not all knowledge can be rendered in pictorial form (e.g., negative facts, logical relations).
10.2.2 The rules for converting perceptual input into knowledge are not themselves pictorial or empirically derived.
11.0 Not all entailment is formal entailment.
11.1 A formal entailment holds when the conditional linking premise to conclusion is formally true.
11.2 Many analytic truths (e.g., "circles are two-dimensional") are not formally true.
11.2.1 Their truth depends on the content of concepts, not merely on logical form.
11.3 Therefore, the *Tractatus* project of reducing all logical relations to formal relations is impossible.
12.0 The concept of a logically perfect language is incoherent.
12.1 In a logically perfect language, grammatical form would perfectly mirror logical form.
12.2 This is impossible because no finite grammar can reflect the infinite complexity of logical relations.
12.2.1 For every formal truth in such a language, there are infinitely many informal analytic truths it cannot express.
12.3 Natural languages, despite their imperfections, are expressively superior to any putative logically perfect language.
13.0 Strict empiricism is self-refuting.
13.1 Empiricism claims all knowledge is based on observation.
13.2 This claim itself cannot be known through observation.
13.3 Therefore, if empiricism is true, there can be no grounds for believing it true.
13.4 Furthermore, foundational parts of scientific knowledge (e.g., involving irrational numbers) cannot have a strictly observational basis.
14.0 The sub-disciplines of philosophy analyze different but interconnected categories.
14.1 Philosophy of Mind studies categories like thought, belief, perception, and consciousness.
14.2 Philosophy of Language studies meaning, reference, and the nature of linguistic representation.
14.3 Epistemology studies the nature, scope, and limits of knowledge.

--- Top Level Only (105 statements) ---

1.0 Philosophy is the analysis of the categories in terms of which we understand the world.
1.1 These categories—such as person, fact, cause, knowledge, language, and justice—structure all thought.
1.1.1 We are adept at using these categories but seldom make them objects of thought.
1.1.2 Consequently, we possess little explicit knowledge about the categories themselves.
1.2 The function of philosophy is to delineate the structures of these categories.
1.2.1 This delineation constitutes the sole legitimate task of philosophy.
1.3 Philosophy is therefore the analysis of the preconditions of all knowledge.
1.3.1 It is the analysis of analysis, the logic of logic, the science of science.
2.0 Philosophical knowledge is metaknowledge—knowledge about knowledge.
2.1 The philosopher is interested in the laws governing the laws, not in the specific facts those laws describe.
2.1.1 The philosopher seeks to know what it would make sense to claim, not merely what is the case.
2.2 The relationship of philosophy to other disciplines is one of increasing abstraction.
2.2.1 The stranded motorist wants his car to work.
2.2.1.1 The engineer wants to know the mechanisms that will make the car work.
2.2.1.1.1 The physicist wants to know the laws embodied in those mechanisms.
2.2.1.1.1.1 The philosopher wants to know what it is to be a law, a mechanism, or a cause.
2.2.2 Thus, the philosopher's interest in specifics is subordinate to an interest in the categories they instantiate.
3.0 Analytic philosophy is distinguished by its method, which originates with Frege.
3.1 Analytic philosophy is driven by the acceptance of a key insight: logical form is not grammatical form.
3.1.1 When a belief seems to have an absurd consequence, one must question whether the absurdity truly follows.
3.1.2 Pre-Fregean philosophy often posited bizarre entities to reconcile beliefs with their apparent grammatical consequences.
3.2 Frege demonstrated that philosophical puzzles are solved by analyzing meanings, not by positing new entities.
3.2.1 For example, "nothing is a square circle" does not refer to a non-entity.
3.2.1.1 Its logical form is: the set of squares does not overlap with the set of circles.
3.2.1.2 It attributes a property (being uninstantiated) to the property of being a square circle.
3.3 Analytic philosophy is thus philosophy that seeks clarity through the logical analysis of statements.
4.0 A fundamental error is to assume that grammatical similarity implies semantic or logical similarity.
4.1 The wrong way to react is to twist reality to fit grammatical assumptions.
4.1.1 For example, assuming "someone" functions like "John" leads to positing ambiguous or non-specific persons.
4.1.2 This path results in absurd theses about non-existent entities.
4.2 The right way to react is to discern the logical form beneath the grammatical surface.
4.2.1 Frege showed that "someone smokes" asserts the property of being a smoker is instantiated.
4.2.2 Quantified statements like "nobody smokes" are about properties (being uninstantiated), not about strange individuals.
4.3 Philosophical explanation is achieved by clarifying statements, not by doing para-science.
5.0 Analytic philosophy is ontologically conservative compared to pre-analytic philosophy.
5.1 Analytic philosophers do not solve problems by "ontologizing"—positing new entities without necessity.
5.1.1 Ontologizing is appropriate only when required to validate indisputably correct forms of inference.
5.1.2 When necessary, the posited entities are always abstract, never spatiotemporal.
5.2 Non-analytic philosophers, like Brentano and Meinong, epitomized the ontologizing method.
5.2.1 To account for hallucinations, they posited non-existent objects as the targets of mental acts.
5.2.2 Proper analysis shows that hallucinations, like veridical perceptions, encode existence-claims.
5.2.2.1 A false existence-claim does not require a non-existent object to be its referent.
6.0 Philosophical puzzles differ in kind from empirical puzzles.
6.1 Empirical puzzles result from a lack of factual data or from inadequate modeling of available data.
6.1.1 Their solution involves acquiring new data or constructing better models of old data.
6.2 Philosophical puzzles are purely conceptual; they result from confusion, not ignorance.
6.2.1 Their solution requires logical analysis, not new observations.
6.2.2 Frege's solutions involved no new empirical discoveries, only a clearer understanding of what was already meant.
7.0 Not all philosophical analysis is linguistic analysis.
7.1 Wittgenstein erroneously held that all philosophical problems arise from the misuse of language.
7.1.1 In the *Tractatus*, he claimed philosophical statements are syntactically ill-formed nonsense.
7.1.2 In the *Investigations*, he claimed meaning is use and puzzles dissolve by examining ordinary usage.
7.2 These positions are incoherent and self-refuting.
7.2.1 The claim that all philosophical statements are nonsense is itself a philosophical statement.
7.2.2 Meaning cannot be identical with use, for knowledge of meaning guides use.
7.3 Many philosophical disputes (e.g., in epistemology or philosophy of law) concern the truth of propositions whose meaning is agreed upon.
7.3.1 The dispute is not about language but about whether a given proposition correctly describes reality.
8.0 One must distinguish between sentences and propositions.
8.1 Sentences are linguistic artifacts; propositions are their mind- and language-independent meanings.
8.2 Truth and falsity are primarily properties of propositions.
8.2.1 A sentence is true if it encodes a true proposition.
8.3 Philosophical analysis is ultimately the analysis of propositions, not sentences.
8.3.1 Frege's analyses of sentences were a means to discover general logical principles governing propositions.
9.0 Logical Positivism, inspired by the *Tractatus*, is an untenable doctrine.
9.1 Its core thesis: a statement is meaningful iff it is either tautological or empirically verifiable/falsifiable.
9.2 This thesis is self-defeating, as it is itself neither a tautology nor an empirical statement.
9.3 Furthermore, there are clear counterexamples: meaningful non-tautological, non-empirical truths exist.
9.3.1 Mathematical truths (e.g., truths of arithmetic) are not tautologies in the stipulated sense.
9.3.2 Principles of logic itself are not empirically verifiable.
9.4 The verificationist and falsificationist criteria of meaning are demonstrably inadequate.
9.4.1 Universal generalizations cannot be conclusively verified.
9.4.2 Existential statements cannot be conclusively falsified.
10.0 The picture theory of meaning is false.
10.1 Sentences are not pictures of the facts they describe.
10.1.1 Sentential representation is heavily conventional; pictorial representation is not.
10.1.2 Sentences have digital, discrete structures; pictures have analog, continuous structures.
10.2 The empiricist motivation for the picture theory fails.
10.2.1 Not all knowledge can be rendered in pictorial form (e.g., negative facts, logical relations).
10.2.2 The rules for converting perceptual input into knowledge are not themselves pictorial or empirically derived.
11.0 Not all entailment is formal entailment.
11.1 A formal entailment holds when the conditional linking premise to conclusion is formally true.
11.2 Many analytic truths (e.g., "circles are two-dimensional") are not formally true.
11.2.1 Their truth depends on the content of concepts, not merely on logical form.
11.3 Therefore, the *Tractatus* project of reducing all logical relations to formal relations is impossible.
12.0 The concept of a logically perfect language is incoherent.
12.1 In a logically perfect language, grammatical form would perfectly mirror logical form.
12.2 This is impossible because no finite grammar can reflect the infinite complexity of logical relations.
12.2.1 For every formal truth in such a language, there are infinitely many informal analytic truths it cannot express.
12.3 Natural languages, despite their imperfections, are expressively superior to any putative logically perfect language.
13.0 Strict empiricism is self-refuting.
13.1 Empiricism claims all knowledge is based on observation.
13.2 This claim itself cannot be known through observation.
13.3 Therefore, if empiricism is true, there can be no grounds for believing it true.
13.4 Furthermore, foundational parts of scientific knowledge (e.g., involving irrational numbers) cannot have a strictly observational basis.
14.0 The sub-disciplines of philosophy analyze different but interconnected categories.
14.1 Philosophy of Mind studies categories like thought, belief, perception, and consciousness.
14.2 Philosophy of Language studies meaning, reference, and the nature of linguistic representation.
14.3 Epistemology studies the nature, scope, and limits of knowledge.
14.4 Philosophical Logic studies entailment, validity, and the structure of propositions.
14.5 Metaphysics studies existence, possibility, necessity, identity, and causation.
14.6 Philosophy of Science studies explanation, theory, confirmation, and the structure of scientific inquiry.
14.7 Ethics studies the nature of good, bad, right, and wrong.
14.8 Political and Legal Philosophy study the nature of law, government, justice, and legitimacy.
14.9 Philosophy of Religion studies concepts of divinity, faith, and religious knowledge.
14.10 Formal Logic studies the systematic formalization of valid inference.
