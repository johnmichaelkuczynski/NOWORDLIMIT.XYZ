PRAGMATISM: EPISTEMOLOGY POSING AS METAPHYSICS


I. INTRODUCTION

• James puts forth several different definitions of pragmatism
• (i) The meaning of a hypothesis lies in its observable consequences
• (ii) A true idea is one that allows us to control the world; a false one does not
• (iii) True ideas are those we can assimilate; false ones are those we cannot
• (iv) Truth happens to an idea
• (v) Truth is made, not discovered
• This list contains some redundancies
• Each of (i)-(v) is false
• However, they are distorted ways of expressing legitimate insights concerning knowledge acquisition


II. (i)-(v) EVALUATED

(i) EVALUATED

• James asks what concrete difference a belief's being true makes in anyone's actual life
• James asks what the truth's cash-value is in experiential terms
• (i) is tantamount to saying you might as well assert O (observable consequences) instead of hypothesis H
• This is false because the relationship between a hypothesis and its observable consequences is always contingent, never analytic
• The relationship depends on what operative conditions and causal mechanisms obtain
• Consider the hypothesis that people are descended from apelike creatures
• The observable consequences concern fossil records, humanoid skeletons, and crudely made weapons
• These are only the observable consequences if certain conditions and causal mechanisms obtain
• Different conditions would yield different observational consequences
• H and O are not equivalent because different conditions and mechanisms might be operative
• One could accept H (humans descended from apes) and deny specific observable predictions without self-contradiction
• Therefore (i) is false

A PRAGMATIST COUNTERARGUMENT

• A pragmatist might argue that if H and O have the same observable consequences, they are equivalent
• The idea is that observationally equivalent hypotheses are metaphysically equivalent
• But this conflates metaphysics with epistemology
• Metaphysics concerns what exists; epistemology concerns what we can know
• Two hypotheses can be epistemologically equivalent (same evidence bears on both) without being metaphysically equivalent (saying the same thing about reality)

WHAT ABOUT HYPOTHESES THAT ARE OBSERVATIONALLY EQUIVALENT FOR REASONS OF NATURAL LAW?

• Some hypotheses are observationally equivalent not by accident but by natural necessity
• Even so, observational equivalence does not entail metaphysical equivalence
• Natural laws themselves are contingent, not necessary truths
• What is observationally equivalent under current laws might not be under different laws

(ii) EVALUATED

• (ii) claims true ideas allow world-control while false ones do not
• This confuses truth with knowledge
• A truth that is unknown provides no control
• It is knowledge of truth, not truth itself, that is empowering
• Many truths exist that provide no power because they are unknown
• The property of being power-enhancing belongs to knowledge, not to truth per se

(iii) EVALUATED

• (iii) claims true ideas are assimilable and false ones are not
• Taken literally, this is at best a half-truth
• There are highly assimilable false ideas
• There are highly non-assimilable true ones
• The pragmatist means that truth IS assimilability
• This is an outright falsehood
• The legitimate insight is that knowledge is assimilated truth
• Beliefs become increasingly knowledge-constitutive as they become increasingly grounded

(iv) AND (v) EVALUATED

• (iv) claims truth happens to an idea
• (v) claims truth is made, not discovered
• Both are false if taken literally
• Truth is a relationship between propositions and reality
• This relationship either obtains or it does not
• It does not come into existence through human activity
• However, knowledge does come into existence through human activity
• Knowledge is made in the sense that it results from cognitive processes
• The pragmatist confuses the making of knowledge with the making of truth
• (v+) "Knowledge is made, not discovered" is eminently defensible
• What is made is our knowledge of truth, not truth itself


III. PRAGMATISM: EPISTEMOLOGY POSING AS ONTOLOGY

• Each pragmatist thesis conflates an epistemological claim with a metaphysical one
• (i) conflates the meaning of a hypothesis with its evidential basis
• (ii) conflates truth with the utility of knowing truth
• (iii) conflates truth with the psychological accessibility of truth
• (iv) and (v) conflate truth with knowledge
• The pattern: pragmatism systematically mistakes features of knowledge for features of truth
• This is why pragmatism is epistemology posing as metaphysics


IV. THE ESSENCE OF PRAGMATISM: WHAT (i)-(v) HAVE IN COMMON

• (i)-(v) combat an intellectualist conception of knowledge
• They replace it with an interactionist or operationalist conception
• They replace an object-oriented conception with an agent-oriented conception

THE NEGATIONS OF (i)-(v)

• (iN) The meaning of a hypothesis is an observation-transcendent reality
• (iiN) An idea can be true without increasing our control over the world
• (iiiN) True ideas are not necessarily more assimilable than false ones
• (ivN) An idea is either true or false; it does not become true
• (vN) Truth is discovered, not made
• Each negation is correct
• However, these negations suggest that knowledge-acquisition is passive reception

CLASSICAL EPISTEMOLOGY (CE)

• CE holds that knowledge-acquisition is about taking note of what exists
• CE holds that the knower should do as little as possible to change what is observed
• Action is about changing what exists; knowledge is about registering it
• Knowledge-acquisition appears antithetical to action on this view
• Actions like telescope-gazing or excavation are mere precursors to observation
• The scientific process proper begins when passive observation begins and action ends

WHAT IS ACTUALLY WRONG WITH CE

• CE may be true in some narrow technical sense
• But intellectual discoveries are made by solving practical problems
• Ventures are undertaken, roadblocks are hit, workarounds are created
• Insights are the collateral damage of these workarounds
• Much of physics is fallout from attempts to create better weapons and dams
• Much of mathematics is constructed to validate this fallout
• Economics was invented to manage the influx of wealth from the New World
• Anthropology was invented to help Europeans interact with colonized peoples
• Psychoanalysis was developed to solve otherwise unsolvable psychiatric problems

EVEN PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS ARE NOT PURELY PHILOSOPHICAL

• Modern epistemology arose in the mid-1600s
• Modern physics and engineering arose at the same time
• Church doctrines lost credibility because they interfered with scientific progress
• With faith-based epistemology no longer possible, new epistemologies were needed
• Hence Cartesian skepticism and Lockean empiricism
• Mathematical logic began in the mid-1800s with George Boole
• Boole's objective was to automate reasoning
• This coincided with the automation of physical production

PURELY THEORETICAL PROBLEMS

• Once a discipline is launched, it can concern itself with purely theoretical problems
• Purely theoretical problems concern mutual coherence of discoveries made solving practical problems
• Calculus was invented to compute planetary orbits and ballistics problems
• Purely theoretical questions about infinitesimals and fractals arose afterward
• These were worth solving only to validate an enormously useful belief-system

THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE TENDS TO BE STALE

• Purely theoretical knowledge tends to be stale and one-dimensional
• Book knowledge of principles often proves useless in practice
• The principles themselves are not false
• What is learned is formalisms based on them, not the principles themselves
• Real understanding comes only when principles are learned to solve practical problems
• Pure theory tends to concern itself with mere schemata

JAMES'S THESIS REINTERPRETED

• James claims ideas are true because they are useful
• Technically this is false
• Trigonometric theorems are useful because they are true, not the reverse
• What is true: truths are learned and worth learning because they are useful
• Theoretical knowledge should exist as long as it is anchored in practical knowledge
• Unanchored theoretical knowledge degenerates into knowledge of empty formalisms
• It is absurd to identify the true with the useful
• It is not absurd to identify the true-worth-learning with the useful

TRUTH IS OBJECTIVE BUT KNOWLEDGE IS RELATIONAL

• Either there is an even number of stars in the galaxy or there is not
• The truth of the matter may not be worth knowing
• Knowledge is a relationship between subject and object
• There is therefore a subjective side to knowledge
• Biologically, intellect exists to help the organism survive and procreate
• In humans, intellect has to some extent become autonomous
• The applied mathematician cares about mathematical relations for practical applications
• The pure mathematician cares about them for their own sake
• But the pure mathematician studies coherence-relations internal to a practically useful dataset

EVEN RECHERCHÉ BRANCHES OF LEARNING HAVE PRACTICAL ROOTS

• The philosopher studies ethical truths for their own sake
• The jurist studies them for practical applications
• But the philosopher investigates coherence-relations internal to a practically important dataset
• The same holds for other branches of philosophy

THE THEORETICIAN AND THE PRACTITIONER

• In contemplating truth disinterestedly, the theoretician exercises the same ability the practitioner uses
• The theoretician is to the practitioner what the martial artist is to the soldier
• The practitioner determines what the theoretician studies and the general lines of study

THE ARTIST AND THE ENGINEER

• Like the engineer, the artist organizes matter (paint, marble, sound)
• The engineer cares about material relations for practical applications
• The artist cares about them for their own sake
• The artist deepens understanding of those relations or exercises ability to understand them
• The artist appears to have turned his back on reality only because he is exercising his ability to engage it
• Interest in truth or beauty for their own sake concerns the cognitive basis of our ability to generate practical results
• James's thesis that truth is utility, though false, is a distorted expression of this truth
