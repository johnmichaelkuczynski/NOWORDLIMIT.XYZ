--- KEY QUOTATIONS ---
1. A 'law of logic' is any statement that belongs to a system of logic or describes a condition that must be satisfied by any such system.
2. A logic is a recursively defined statement-set.
3. In order for a logic to have any value, it must be consistent.
4. If phi is the recursion that generates a given logic, phi is truth-preservative.
5. If p is true, and q follows from p, then q is true.
6. Modus ponens can be taken to say that, if chi is any chosen specification of the consequence relation, then chi of p is true whenever p is true.
7. According to the principle of transitivity, if p entails q and q entails r, then p entails r.

    "No logic contains every true statement, nonetheless, any given true statement belongs to many a logic.",
    "A statement that is neither true nor false is one whose consequences are neither true nor false, whose negation is neither true nor false, and the consequences of whose negation are neither true nor false. Such a statement is a perfect nullity."
